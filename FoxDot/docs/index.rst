Welcome to FoxDot's documentation!
==================================

`FoxDot`_ is a Python library and programming environment that provides a fast and 
user-friendly abstraction to the powerful audio-engine, SuperCollider. It comes 
with its own IDE, which means it can be used straight out of the box; all you need 
is Python and SuperCollider and you're ready to go!

For more information on installation, check out the :doc:`guides/installation`, 
or if you're already set up, you can also find a useful :doc:`guides/gettingstarted` guide that introduces the
key components of FoxDot.

If you still need help, check out the `FAQ`_, or you can drop by the ``#foxdot`` channel on
`slack`_, drop by `the discussion board`_, or `file a bug`_ in the issue tracker. 
Please let us know where you think this documentation can be improved.
